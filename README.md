🔰 What the project does:
It's a Calculator webapp,it takes input from the user and does any mathematical operations the user intends.

🔰Tools/languages used : 
📝Text Editor : VS Code
 Extensions: Live Server (for  hosting local development server)
 For live Hosting :  Vercel
💾Languages used:
#HTML
#CSS
#JavaScript

🔰Steps to build and run it :
1. I had to setup VS  code so that I can  use the necessary languages for the project.I also had to install necessary extensions like  HTML CSS support,Live Server etc.
2. Used HTML to create a basic layerout,added buttons for number and operations , used data attributes for selecting the buttons in  javascript.
3. Used CSS to arrange the buttons and for styling
4. Used JavaScript to handle the Backend part by  defining class,core methods
5. Constantly checked the interface using Live Server after designing each parts.
6. Then used Vercel to host it by using the Github repo of the project.

🔰Challenges and Key features:
As I'm new to javaScript and used to code in Java, it was difficult for me to distinguish between DOM elements and values at first which resulted in mixing between these two,took a quite an effort debugging  it.
Speaking of key features,I kept the Calculator very simple so it will be easily accessible for anyone.
